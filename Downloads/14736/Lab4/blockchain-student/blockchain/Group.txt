# Our Git Repository:

# Run & Test
1. Before 'make', run the following command first to set the class path in command line
    export CLASSPATH= $CLASSPATH:/path_to_project/hash/commons-codec-1.11.jar
For Example(On my own Machine):
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/Downloads/14736/Lab4/blockchain-student/blockchain/hash/commons-codec-1.11.jar

2. In Config.java, method 'waitUntilAllRegister()'
I changed the Thread.sleep() time from 10 millis to 30 millis, in order to provide enough time for all Nodes to get Registered
